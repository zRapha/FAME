**************************

Welcome to ARMED & AIMED/RL (AxMED): Automatic Random/Intelligent Malware Modifications to Evade Detection 

AxMED was designed to understand how automatically injected perturbations to Windows portable executable (PE) malware impact static classifiers without affecting the sample's functionality and thus keeping the new malicious mutations valid. This work implements the action space and GBDT model proposed on the [OpenAI gym malware](https://github.com/endgameinc/gym-malware) environment. It has been originally implemented using Fedora 29/30 and tested on Ubuntu 16.

## Part 1: Installation instructions 

Download the ARMED/AIMED repository: 
```
$ git clone https://github.com/zRapha/AIMED 
```
Create a virtual environment & activate it: 
```
$ python3 -m venv axmed-env
$ source axmed-env/bin/activate
```
Install required packages: 
```
$ pip install -r requirements.txt 
```
## Part 2: Functionality test environment  
Per default it will be used a Cuckoo analysis environment that has an extensive documentation support: https://cuckoo.sh/docs/. Cuckoo provides dynamic analysis results, which can be useful to understand the adversarial examples generated. A local beta-test implementation is also provided to avoid using an external service. 

## Part 3: Detection environment  
A local classification model is implemented to perform detection using a pre-trained classifier. For those looking for more results, we provide the option of using agreggators via REST APIs in order to assess adversarial examples against a wider range of scanners. 

## Part 4: Dataset 
There are several public repositories containing labeled malicious samples to test the environment. Once the data is acquired, it should be placed under samples/unzipped/. 

## Further environment isolation [Optional] 
Even though the manipulations do not require to run any file, the functionality stage does. Hence, it is  recommended to use isolated sandboxes and simulated services. One option is to use inetsim. 

Disable interface: 
```
$ sudo ifconfig <network_int> down 
```

Run inetsim:
```
$ cd /etc/default/inetsim-1.2.8/ 
$ sudo ./inetsim 
```

Note that automatically retrieving the detection rate for a malware sample from an online agreggator will no longer be functional unless adjusted or checked manually.

## Part 5: How to run AxMED

1. Activate Cuckoo Python venv: 
```
$ source ~/Documents/venvs/cuckoo-env/bin/activate
```

2. Run Mongo DB for webserver: 
```
$ sudo service mongod start 
```

3. Run webserver [optional]: 
```
$ cd ~/.cuckoo/ 
$ cuckoo web 
```

4. Run API & Cuckoo sandbox: 
```
$ cuckoo api 
$ cuckoo
```
5. Run AxMED to find m adversarial examples by injecting p perturbations: 
```
$ ./axmed.py -p 5 -m 1
```

Observation: Note that an early working version of the AIMED-RL module has been provided along with the paper publication. However, a new and more adjusted release is expected around Q22022.
